### Business Problem Overview and Solution Approach

In service-oriented industries like banking, customer churn—defined as customers
   discontinuing their current service to switch to another provider—poses a significant
   challenge. Understanding the factors that influence a customer's decision to leave is
   critical. This knowledge allows management to prioritize and target their efforts
   effectively, aiming to enhance those service aspects that are most impactful in
   retaining customers.
   In order to tackle the challenge of customer churn in the banking industry, we
   employed a data-driven approach. Our dataset comprises various features that could
   potentially influence a customer's decision to churn, such as account balance, credit
   score, and tenure with the bank. We began by conducting an exploratory data analysis
   to gain insights into the data and identify patterns. Following this, we preprocessed
   the data by dropping some features, scaling numerical features, and encoding
   categorical variables.
